Delphi Version Selector
=======================

This tool can be used to open Delphi project files with the correct version of Delphi.


Supported versions of Delphi
----------------------------
I think I used Delphi 2006 to compile the code, but it compiled under 10.2 as it was.
Delphi 1 to XE6 are supported by the tool to open projects created with these versions.

Todo
----
Current versions of Delphi (XE7 and higher) are not supported yet.

You would like to contribute?
-----------------------------
You can send your commits as pull requests. This is the easiest way for you since I'll do
the merging if neccessary.
